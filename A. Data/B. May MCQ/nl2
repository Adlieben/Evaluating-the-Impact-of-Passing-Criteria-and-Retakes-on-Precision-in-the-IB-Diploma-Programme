The four sheets expected are:

- nl1007: the item scores for component nl1007.
- nl527: the item scores for component nl527.
- nl441: the item scores for component nl441.
- nl584: the item scores for component nl584.

Each row of each sheet corresponds to a student.

The first half of the variables represents students' responses to test items. 
These are labelled Q1 to Q30 for sheets with 60 observations, and Q1 to Q40 for sheets with 80 observations.

The second half contains the corresponding scores for each item.
These are labelled NQ1 to NQ30 or NQ1 to NQ40, respectively, using the same indexing as the response variables.
