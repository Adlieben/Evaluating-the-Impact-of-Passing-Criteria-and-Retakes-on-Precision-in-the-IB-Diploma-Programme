# Project

This is the code used to complete the project 'Evaluating the Impact of Passing Conditions and Retakes on Precision in the IB’s Diploma Programme', originally as part of a Master's thesis in joint collaboration between Utrecht University (UU) and the International Baccalaureate Organization (IBO).

As part of the data privacy policy of the IBO, the data used for the project is not made available here. Instead, only the code in R and Fortran is provided for use in potential future studies. To request access to the data for replication purposes, please contact Dr. Anton Béguin (anton.beguin@ibo.org), Director of Educational Innovation at the IBO. Requests will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis.

For questions regarding the code, please contact Adam Maghout (a.maghout@students.uu.nl) or raise an issue on this repository.

# Structure

The code is organised in several folders:
- **A. Data**: A folder containing the data used for the study. Currently empty.
- **B. Preparation**: A folder containing scripts in R used to obtain intermediate results, such as reliabilities and the increment distributions.
- **C. Main Analysis**: A folder containg scripts in R and Fortran used to obtain the main results concerning precision and passing rates.
- **D. Results**: A folder containing the results of the analysis. Results are given for each iteration so other plots and summary statistics can be computed.
- **Final_report.pdf**: The final report that was submitted as a result of this study.

The original structure of the project is maintained with empty folders to facilitate its replication. Once the data files are obtained, they can thus simply be added to the data folder.
